## Description

This project is a recreation of the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake that grows longer with each food consumed. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself. Special foods trigger specific effects, and the game tracks score and highscore, providing a competitive edge for players. The game includes multiple menus like Start, Pause, and Game Over, with a rich visual interface featuring images for foods and the snake.
